# Welcome
## Hi
### How're ya

I'm Felix, a UNSW Compsci student

I currently work as an office assistant and food service assistant at a nursing home. I have experience doing a lot of different jobs, from setting up events/conventions to private English tutoring to your friendly neighbourhood lollipop man!

I enjoy the puzzle-like nature of coding and design, and my current favourite language is Rust; Memory safety? Type safety? Zero-cost abstractions with all the control?? An (unofficial) crab icon ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€??? RustDoc???? Fearless concurrency????? Macros?????? 

My favourite project so far is probably [SokobanInator](https://github.com/Felix-Lin-8864/sokoban-inator/tree/main), though I play [AnagramInator](https://github.com/Felix-Lin-8864/Anagrams/tree/main) more (I used to spam people with GamePigeon anagrams).

This portfolio of mine showcases my projects, study resources and unmatched sense of humour in a familiar format!

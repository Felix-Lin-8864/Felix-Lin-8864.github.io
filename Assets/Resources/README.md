### Composition

This static portfolio website is written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS with lots of Markdown files (READMEs from other projects). For this project, I used the Marked library to parse Markdown files to HTML and insert them in an element for display.

### Deployments
This project is deployed on GitHub Pages through the compiled build in dist.

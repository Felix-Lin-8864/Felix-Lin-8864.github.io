# Welcome

Hi, I'm Felix.

I currently study compsci at UNSW, and work part-time as an office assistant and food service assistant at a nursing home. I have worked many jobs in the past (from setting up events/conventions to private HSC English tutoring to lollipop man) and enjoy learning new things while doing so, but my focus is now set on starting a career in industry.

What I enjoy most about programming and design is their logical, puzzle-like nature, and my favourite language is Rust; I like its straight-forward, structured and 'governed' philosophy and system (the performance, and static memory and type safety guarantees definitely don't hurt though). 

Of my projects, my favourite is [AnagramInator](https://github.com/Felix-Lin-8864/Anagrams); an anagrams-based web game. However, the ones I found most interesting to develop were [SokobanInator](https://github.com/Felix-Lin-8864/sokoban-inator) (an Entity Component System game) and [WordChainInator](https://github.com/Felix-Lin-8864/word-chain-game/) (an online multiplayer word game using web sockets).

Please explore the rest of my portfolio, and check out my projects and study resources!
